      	<h1>My Goals</h1>
        <h2>Well Rounded Technical Skills</h2>
        <h4>I make it my goal to be able to use any and every device I come into contact with. I enjoy testing myself with operating systems and software that I am not used to using so that I can test if I truly understand how a UI in general would be structured. Once I understand the basics of the UI for a given platform, I am usually able to use that device with ease. I use my knowledge of technology not only for myself, but also to help anybody around me that is having difficulty with it. I've always enjoyed helping people use technology because of how rewarding it feels to know I was helpful to somebody.</h4>
        <h2>Game Developer</h2>
        <h4>I have wanted to be a game developer ever since I was a child. Games brought me so much enjoyment as a child, and I have always looked up to the people that make the kind of game a person will remember for their entire life. My goal is to make that kind of impression on a person with my own games.
        I have always looked up to the independent developers especially, and not the big name developers such as EA and Bethesda. The people who get together with a small group of friends and make a masterpiece that rivals the games of a multi billion dollar organization are my heroes. If I make a game, then I would like to do it as an independent developer, and not working under a big name corporation.</h4>
